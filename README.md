## Can Amazon Reviews Help Businesses Learn to Find their Best Customers? 

## Goals


The key question we look to answer is whether knowing the text of an Amazon Customer Review can help us predict the star rating of that review.

Eventually our goal is to provide these insights to businesses as a service to help them identify customers most likely to love or hate their products based on the things they are saying about them.
