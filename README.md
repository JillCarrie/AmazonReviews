## Goals


The key question we look to answer is whether knowing the text of an Amazon Customer Review can help us predict the star rating of that review.

Our goal is to eventually improve our process to a level where it can be deployed on customer conversations anywhere to help businesses identify customers most likely to love or hate their products based on the things they are saying.
